This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/rich-giraffe-512812).

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

In this challenge I've built my own implementation of `grep`. Along the way
I've learnt about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.

The entry point for the grep-linux implementation is in app/main.py. Study and uncomment the relevant code as applicable.

Special Thanks for [@codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/rich-giraffe-512812) for enhancing this learning!
